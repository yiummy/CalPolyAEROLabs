# CalPolyAEROLabs
Repo for lab code to help with maintenance and future use 

As the Cal Poly AERO labs continue to evolve, systems for DAQ change and require upkeep. LabVIEW, from National Instruments, as worked well in the past, but updates to the software and windows operating systems create issues to resolve. With the new liquid biprop engine in use for Fall 2024, data acquisition shifted to using microcontrollers (specifically a Teensy4.1) to record data and send via Serial connection to a recording computer. This enables live plotting of the data and recording of the .csv files after the experiement. The initial folders and commits to this repository will document the microcontroller and serial monitoring software. Note that the serial monitoring software was pulled from another Github repositiory, and requires Rust to use.
